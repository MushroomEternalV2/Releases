## Usage

In manual mode, the mod will highlight profitable deals, allowing you to snipe items manually while still having full control over purchases.

### Automatic Mode

In automatic mode, the mod will continuously scan the Auction House and purchase items that meet your preset criteria. This allows for passive income generation while you focus on other in-game activities.

## Best Practices for AH Flipping

- **Start Small** – If you're new to flipping, begin with lower-value items to understand market trends.
- **Research Market Prices** – Use external tools or community resources to track item values over time.
- **Avoid Overbuying** – Don't flood the market with too many of the same item, as this may lower your profit margins.
- **Check Demand** – Some items have high demand and sell quickly, while others take longer.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with Mushroom Eternal, try the following steps:

1. **Ensure Your Minecraft Client is Updated** – Compatibility issues can arise with outdated versions.
2. **Check for Conflicting Mods** – Some other AH-related mods may interfere with functionality.
3. **Verify API Access** – Hypixel’s API may be required for certain features. Make sure it’s enabled.
4. **Restart Your Game** – A simple restart can resolve many performance-related issues.
