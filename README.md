## Best Practices for AH Flipping 📈

➡️ **Start Small** – If you're new to AH flipping, begin with lower-value items to get a feel for the market before scaling up. 🧑‍🏫  
➡️ **Research Market Prices** – Keep track of historical trends and use community tools to help identify the value of items over time. 📚  
➡️ **Avoid Overbuying** – Don’t flood the market with too many of the same item, as this can drive prices down and hurt your margins. 🚫  
➡️ **Check Demand** – Some items sell quickly, while others may take longer. Be sure to prioritize high-demand items for quicker flips. 🚀
