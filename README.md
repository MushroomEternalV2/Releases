## Best Practices for AH Flipping 📈

➡️ **Start Small** – If you're new to flipping, begin with lower-value items to understand market trends.  
➡️ **Research Market Prices** – Use external tools or community resources to track item values over time.  
➡️ **Avoid Overbuying** – Don't flood the market with too many of the same item, as this may lower your profit margins.  
➡️ **Check Demand** – Some items have high demand and sell quickly, while others take longer.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

If you experience issues with Mushroom Eternal, try the following steps:

1. **Ensure Your Minecraft Client is Updated** – Compatibility issues can arise with outdated versions.  
2. **Check for Conflicting Mods** – Some other AH-related mods may interfere with functionality.  
3. **Verify API Access** – Hypixel’s API may be required for certain features. Make sure it’s enabled.  
4. **Restart Your Game** – A simple restart can resolve many performance-related issues.
